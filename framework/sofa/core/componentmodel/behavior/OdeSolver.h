/**
 *  \brief Component responsible for timestep integration, i.e. advancing the state from time t to t+dt.
 *
 *  This class currently control both the integration scheme (explicit,
 *  implicit, static, etc), and the linear system resolution algorithm
 *  (conjugate gradient, matrix direct inversion, etc). Those two aspect will
 *  propably be separated in a future version.
 *
 *  While all computations required to do the integration step are handled by
 *  this object, they should not be implemented directly in it, but instead
 *  the solver propagates orders (or Visitor) to the other components in the
 *  scenegraph that will locally execute them. This allow for greater
 *  flexibility (the solver can just ask for the forces to be computed without
 *  knowing what type of forces are present), as well as performances
 *  (some computations can be executed in parallel).
