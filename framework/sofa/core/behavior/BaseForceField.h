 *  \brief Component computing forces within simulated bodies.
 *
 *  This class define the abstract API common to all force fields.
 *  A force field computes forces applied to one or more simulated body
 *  given its current position and velocity.
 *
 *  Forces can be internal to a given body (attached to one MechanicalState,
 *  see the ForceField class), or link several bodies together (such as contact
 *  forces, see the InteractionForceField class).
 *
 *  For implicit integration schemes, it must also compute the derivative
 *  ( df, given a displacement dx ).
