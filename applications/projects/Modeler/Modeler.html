                The scene graph is fully modifiable. <br>
                To add new components to the scene graph, <b>DRAG</b> from the Sofa Library located on the left on the application, and <b>DROP</b> it inside a <b>Node</b> of the graph.<br>
                You can try your scene under construction at any time by using the <b>RunSofa</b> menu, or pressing <b>CTRL+R</b>.<br>

                Some preset objects are available to quickly add in your scene obstacles, rigid and deformable objects. <b>Right click</b> on a <b>Node</b> and select your preset.
