/** \mainpage
  Simulation of deformable object using a formulation similar to the KKT system for hard constraints, regularized using a compliance matrix.

  Provides implicit time integration combined with constraint stabilization.

  See Compliant/doc/compliant.pdf and Compliant/doc/compliant-reference.pdf for more detail.

  See also class sofa::component::odesolver::AssembledSolver

  A test suite is available, see page \ref Page_CompliantTestSuite
