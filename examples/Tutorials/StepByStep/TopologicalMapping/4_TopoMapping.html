		This step shows that it is possible to define mechanical behavior directly on child topology. this can be usefull as often the surfacique mesh is only a small part of the entire topology.

		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div>
        <ul>
		  <li>Springs are added to the edges on surface of the mesh using <b>TriangularBendingSprings</b>.</li>
		  <li><b>TriangleModel</b> component can be added to interact with the model (use shift + left mouse button).</li>
		</ul>

		<br><div id="orangeText">Results</div><br>
		In this step, edges on the surface of the mesh have springs, thus the cylinder doesn't bend as mush as in previous steps.
		The interest is that elements in the rest of the cylinder are not taken into account, leading to faster computation.
