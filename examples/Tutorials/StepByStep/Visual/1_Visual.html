		This tutorial follows directly the previous one, and shows how to load mesh files which are not in OBJ format.<br>
		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
		As we saw previously, <b>OglModel</b> can render simply OBJ file. This was done directly in this component because OBJ is widely used.
		But if you have less common format files, there is a different method to render them.
		<br>
		<b>MeshLoader</b> is used to load several kind of files. Connect its loaded data in <b>OglModel</b> which will used it to visualize.
		In this example, we render a VTK file, using <b>MeshVTKLoader</b>.
