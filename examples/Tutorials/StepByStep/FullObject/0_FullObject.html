		<br><div id="orangeText">Description</div><br>
		The objective of this tutorial is to create a simulation with collisions between a deformable body and an obstacle. We will use some of the most common components of the SOFA framework trying not to enter into all the details related to the template selection. This will be done in another tutorial.<br>
                The starting point will be a scene with all the components needed to handle collisions in a scene, and a visual model representing our deformable object.

		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
                This is how the collisions are performed in SOFA using these default components.<br><br>
                <b>DefaultPipeline</b>: Launch all the operations to perform the collision detection and response

                <h4>Collision Detection:</h4> 
                <ol> 
                  <li><u>Broad Phase</u>: using "Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes" (AABB), we only keep potential colliding pair of objects</li>
                  <li><u>Narrow Phase</u>: we use the geometrical primitives (spheres, triangles, lines, points) to test the distance between two objects. <br>
                    we use the <b>BruteForceDetection</b> to select which primitives will be used, and the <b>MinProximityIntersection</b> to detect if a collision exists between two geometrical primitives</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Collision Response:</h4>
                <ol> 
                  <li>with all the colliding primitives, we create an appropriate collision response: the <b>ContactManager</b> gives the information about what response we have to use. </li>
                  <li>Components are created dynamically in the graph to create repulsive forces, or constraints. In this tutorial, we will create <b>PenalityContactForceField</b>. </li>        
                </ol>
                <br>
               
                Advanced collision detection and response are implemented in SOFA, so don't hesitate to experiment other examples.

                In this scene, we only have a <b>OglModel</b> corresponding to a pure visual representation of an object.<br> Nothing happens.
