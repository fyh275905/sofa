		We get rid of the <b>PlaneForceField</b>. We will use now a true obstacle modeled with a topology (read from a mesh file), a mechanical object, and some collision models.

		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
                To use the Collision Pipeline described <a href="0_FullObject.scn">here</a>, you need to use Collision Models. They describe geometrical primitives which will be involved in the collision detection. To demonstrate the flexibility you can have, we will use at the same time some spheres, triangles, lines and points.<br>
                There will be as many spheres as particules contained in the Topology. <br>
                At this point, our deformable object will interact with the floor using spheres placed at each corner of the cells. 

		<br><br>
		The collision detection does not take correctly into accounT what we visually see, but the dragon does not pass through the floor.

		<br><div id="orangeText">Results</div><br>
                You have several way to modify the collision detection and response.<br>
                Modify the proximity distance to know when two primitives are colliding: open <b>MinProximityIntersection</b> and edit "alarmDistance" and "contactDistance". <br>
                Modify the stiffness of the response: the response is computed using the product of the contactStiffness of the two collision models involved. Open <b>SphereModel</b> and edit this parameter. You can do the same process with the <b>TriangleModel</b>, <b>LineModel</b>, <b>PointModel</b>.
