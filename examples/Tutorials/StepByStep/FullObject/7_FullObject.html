                In this tutorial we just changed the collision model, and using the same model as the visual one. 

		<br><div id="orangeText">Results</div><br>
                You can see there are much more spheres to handle the collision, some are redondant, and useless. This example is to demonstrate than you need to carefully chose the collision model you want to use. A good way is to have two version of your model: a fine version used to do the rendering of the scene, and a much coarser one, to handle the collisions quickly. The presence of spheres may create some artifacts during the collision response, but are very fast to simulate (disable the display of the collision models and activate the visual models to really see the efficiency of the spheres).
