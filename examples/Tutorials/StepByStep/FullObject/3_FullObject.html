		Now that we have a topology, a mechanical object well initialized, it is time to simulate the deformation of the object. To do so, we add a ForceField to the scene. You have to put a compatible forcefield: compatible means, it must use the same template as your <b>MechanicalObject</b> (here we used Vec3d: you won't be able to add force fields using Rigid types for instance), and some force fields rely on a given topology. Most of the time, their name informs you about this topology. <br>
                In this scene, the <b>SparseGridTopology</b> creates hexahedra corresponding to the cells of the grid: thus you can use all Hexahedron based ForceFields.

                We chose to model our deformation using Finite Elements: <b>HexahedronFEMForceField</b>.

		<br><br>
		Now you should see the hexahedra corresponding to the Finite Elements. When you simulate, you will be able to see the deformation of the cells of the grid.

                Modify the young modulus of the FEM force field: the higher, the stiffer will be the model. <br>
                Modify the poisson ratio (between 0 and 0.5).
