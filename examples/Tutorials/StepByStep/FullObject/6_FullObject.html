		Like we did in <a href="4_FullObject.scn">this part</a> of the tutorial, we will map another model to the simulated mechanical object. This time, it won't be only a visual model, but a mechanical object which goal will be to handle the collisions, and to transmit to the simulated object the forces due to the collision response. <br>
                Once this model is able to transmit the forces, we just need to add some collision models like we did <a href="5_FullObject.scn">here </a><br>
                Remember:
                <ul>
                  <li> <u>Visual Mapping</u>: the information is passed Top-Down: the simulated object propagates the positions  <i>(method apply) </i> and the velocities <i>(method applyJ)</i> to the mapped model</li>
                  <li> <u>Mechanical Mapping</u>: the information is passed both ways: the simulated object propagates the posisions  <i>(method apply) </i> and the velocities  <i>(method applyJ) </i> to the mapped model, and the mapped model propagates the forces to the simulated object  <i>(method applyJT) </i></li>
                </ul>


		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
                We create a new node containing the collision object: we need to load the model from a mesh file. Thus, we will use the <b>MeshTopology</b>, using the parameter "fileTopology" to specify the file. As a first example we use a cube a collision object.<br>
                We need a MechanicalObject to store the positions, velocities and forces of the collision object.<br>
                We map the collision object to the simulated deformable model using a Mapping, this time a MechanicalMapping <b>BarycentricMapping</b>.<br> 
                You may wonder what is the difference between this mapping and the one used for the visual model, as we are using the same component! what makes a mapping visual or mechanical?<br>
                This is determined by the template used to create the mapping: if you open the MechanicalMapping, and go to the tabulation "infos" you can read:<br>

                <i>Template: MechanicalMapping  &lt;Vec3d, Vec3d &gt;</i><br>
                 it means it transforms a state expressed by Vec3d types into Vec3d: REMEMBER, collision models are only expressed in Vec3d type, so the mapped state MUST be of Vec3d types.<br>
                You need to specify where can be found the two mechanical states using the parameters "object1" and "object2". By default they provide a mapping from the mechanical state placed above ("../.."), to the mechanical state of the current node ("..").

		<br><div id="orangeText">Results</div><br>
		You can see 8 spheres, corresponding to the 8 corners of the cube chosen to represent our collision model. Of course, 8 spheres to do the collision detection is much faster than 171 of the previous scene. The behaviour is much different too. If you apply a force on one of the spheres using the mouse, you will be able to deform the object: this is due to the MechanicalMapping. <br>
                We displayed some debug information about the mechanical mapping using blue lines: one point of the collision model depends on several points of the simulated object: if a force is applied to one of the point of the collision model, it will propagate it to the points it depends on.
