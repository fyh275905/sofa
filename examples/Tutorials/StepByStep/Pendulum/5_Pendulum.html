                We add another mechanical object, with its own mass. Since it is placed below the the solver component, it will be taken into account during the simulation step.

                During the <a href="0_Pendulum.scn">first part</a> of this tutorial, we described how to create a mechanical object. We use the same Sofa Component, <b>MechanicalObject</b> and <b>UniformMass</b>. We create only one particle, and place it at the position (2, 0, 0).

		<br><div id="orangeText">Results</div><br>
                You should see now 3 particles: 2 belonging to the first object, and a third from the second object we just created. As no interaction exists between the two objects, the particles falls according to the gravity.
