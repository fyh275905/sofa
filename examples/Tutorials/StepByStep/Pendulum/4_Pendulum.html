		<br><div id="orangeText">Description</div><br>
		The concept of Forces are handled by components called ForceField in Sofa. We implemented numerous algorithms to simulate Mass Spring system, Finite Elements, Rigid Bodies, ... In the Modeler, open the section ForceFields, and try the different examples provided (a click on a component will display an example associated).<br>
                In this tutorial, we will add a Spring between the two particles.

		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
                We use a <b>StiffSpringForceField</b> to model it. if you edit this component, you will find the parameter "spring": it contains all the parameters needed to create a spring: two indices (index1, index2) corresponding to the particles attached by the spring, a stiffness coefficient (Ks), a dumping coefficient (Kd), and the rest length of the spring (L).

		<br><br>
                The two particles are now linked together by a spring. The second particles continues to fall because of the gravity but a spring, displayed by a green line, keeps them close. We have modeled a very basic pendulum with only 5 components.

                Don't rush, and take some time to customize this scene: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Modify the parameters of the spring, its rest length, Ks, Kd</li>
                  <li>Change the mass of the particles of the mechanical object</li>
                  <li>Change the position of the particles of the mechanical object</li>
                  <li>Add another particle, and create a second spring with different parameters</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
The next objective will be to create an interaction between two mechanical objects to simulate a more complex pendulum.
