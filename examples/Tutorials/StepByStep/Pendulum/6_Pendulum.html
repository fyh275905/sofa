		<center><h3>Creation of a Pendulum (7/8)</h3></center>
		<div id="orangeText">Description</div><br>
                To link the two different mechanical objects, we will create a spring between them.

		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
                We use the same component (<b>StiffSpringForceField</b>)as in <a href="4_Pendulum.scn">this part</a> of the tutorial. But you may notice that the colour used in the scene graph is not the same. Internal Springs use a blue color, Interaction Springs use a red colour. The difference with the previous use of the <b>StiffSpringForceField</b>, resides in the fact that we need to specify the two mechanical objects in interaction: if you edit the component "Interaction Spring", you will find two parameters "object1" and "object2". We specified the path to the node containing the Mechanical Objects, "FirstObject" and "SecondObject". The creation of the spring is then exactly identical: two indices, Ks, Kd, rest length.

                A second green is display, representing the interaction between the two objects. You may want to reduce the integration time step to have a better visualization of what is simulated. <br>
                To end this tutorial, and to show the genericity of Sofa, the last tutorial will simulated the same scene but using a different ODE solver, and integration scheme.
