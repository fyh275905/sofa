                The objective of this small step by step tutorial is to discover the basic components used with SOFA, how they interact, and how you can configure them. We will create a pendulum made of two objects, and two different springs. We will not go into details on the template used for the mechanical states, or the forcefields used.<br>
                

		<br><div id="orangeText">Components:</div><br>
                We used 3 components:
                <ul>
                  <li> A <b>Node</b> "FirstObject" to store the components describing our object we want to simulate. It is important that the hierarchy of your nodes in the scene graph reflects the scene you want to model.</li>
                  <li> The shape is modeled using a <b>MechanicalObject</b> which desribes the particle states. </li>
                  <li> A <b>UniformMass</b> is added for each particle, giving for each particle of the MechanicalObject a mass. </li>
                </ul>

                In Sofa, you can see one Particle represented by a white dot. If you animate the scene... nothing happens.<br>
