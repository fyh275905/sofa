	ForceFields are components that exhibit mechanical propreties in Sofa. These might be illustrated 
	by several theories like linear elasticity, hyperelasticity, visco-elasticity ... These propreties 
	allow computing the mechanical reponse of object when an external force is sollicited.   
	They are mechanical intrinsic propreties, normally do not depend to the size or shap of object.
	Unfortunately, ForceFields in Sofa deeply depend to the object's topology. 
	When choosing a ForceFields, user must take care about the apropriated Topology. ForceField components 
	might have the name of a specific mechanical model. In this case, user can search documentation for deep 
	acknowledge. In other cases, ForceFields are mostly named by the combined the name of computation method,
	topology type ...
