		<div id="orangeText">Description:</div>
		<br>
                The Skinning Mapping is widely used in computer animation:
                <ul>
                  <li>we set a weight to each simulated node</li>
                  <li>by computing the influence of each node on a particule of the skin, we are able to model its deformation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We implemented lots of different algorithms to let the user configure its skinning mapping the way he desires, adjusting the tradeoff between performance and quality.

		<div id="orangeText">Weighting algorithms:</div>       
                The diffusion of the weights through the structure can be done using the inverse of the square distance, linear, hermitian, spline.
                <ul>
                  <li>Inverse of the square distance</li>
                  <li>Linear along the distance</li>
                  <li>Hermite</li>
                  <li>Spline</li>
                </ul>

		<div id="orangeText">Distance algorithms:</div>
                To know this influence, we can use the distance of the particule of the skin to each simulated node. This distance can be
                <ul>
                  <li>Euclidian</li>
                  <li>Geodesic</li>
                  <li>Harmonic</li>
                </ul>

		<div id="orangeText">Interpolating algorithms:</div>                
                We implemented two methods to interpolate the deformation of the particules: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Linear Interpolation: the fastest, but can result in some nasty visual artifacts</li>
                  <li>Dual Quaternion: it gives much nicer results, but is slightly slower</li>
                </ul>
