                The StaticSolver contains the algorithm used to update particle positions at each time step. As we are dealing with a Static solver, time is not taken into account: it can be useful to measure the convergence of several algorithms.<br>
                It uses an auxiliary component, the CGLinearSolver, to solve equation systems. <br>
