		In this tutorials, we will introduce the different topologies existing in SOFA. Indeed, depending on the number of dimension representing our mechnanical object (1D,2D or 3D), a suitable topologies has to be found.<br><br>
		For a linear object (1D), beams must be used.
		For a surface object (2D), the user can choose between different element type such as triangles or quads.
		And finally, for a volume object (3D), tetraedral or hexaedral topologies are available.
		The choice of the element type is very important and has to be done depending on the geometry to mesh and on the aimed simulation.<br><br>

		Once the type of element has been properly chosen, you need to import the topology of your objects in SOFA.<br>
		- If you are using an imported mesh, you just need to use the suitable meshLoader or use the MeshTopology to load the whole object tolopology.<br>

		- Otherwise, you will have to define the following component in your scene file:
		<ul>
		  <li> SetTopologyContainer,</li>
		  <li> SetTopologyModifier,</li>
		  <li> SetTopologyAlgorithms,</li>
		  <li> SetGeometryAlgorithms.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>Almost all the topologies implemented in SOFA are linear elements. The implementation of quadratic elements is however possible but the topology are to be reconsider. </p>

		<p>Finally, we also introduce in this tutorial the notion of TopologicalMapping. It corresponds to transformation mapping one topology on anotherone. It is thereby possible to get a tetraedral mesh based on a hexaedral mesh.</p>
